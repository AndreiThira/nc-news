# NC-News-FE
This project represents my first attempt at creating a web application, as introduced by Northcoders. This application is a replica of a news website, featuring a range of functionalities designed to enhance the user's experience.

Key features of my application include:

- **Article Filters**: Easily find articles of interest by applying filters based on various criteria.
- **Comment System**: Engage with the community by leaving comments on articles.
- **Upvoting**: Show your support for articles and comments through the upvoting system.

My project serves as a practical exploration of web development concepts and showcases my initial steps into creating web applications.

The BackEnd can be found [here](https://github.com/AndreiThira/andrei-be-nc-news).
